    <h2>Causes of Floods</h2>
    <section class="causes">
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy Rainfall: Intense or prolonged rainfall can lead to overflowing rivers, streams, and other water bodies, causing them to breach their banks and flood surrounding areas.</li>
        
            <li>Snowmelt: Rapid melting of snow, particularly in mountainous regions or areas with significant snow accumulation, can lead to an influx of water into rivers and streams, contributing to flooding.</li>
        
            <li>Storm Surges: Coastal flooding can occur due to storm surges generated by tropical storms, hurricanes, or cyclones. These powerful storms can push large amounts of water inland.</li>
        
            <li>River Overflow: When rivers receive excessive water from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both, they may overflow their banks, inundating nearby areas.</li>
        
            <li>Dam or Levee Failure: Failure of dams, levees, or other water control systems due to structural issues, excessive water pressure, or erosion can cause sudden and significant flooding downstream.</li>
    
            <li> Urbanization and Land Use Changes: The alteration of natural landscapes due to urban development, deforestation, or improper land use can disrupt natural drainage patterns, leading to increased surface runoff and higher flood risks.</li>
            <li>   Climate Change: Changing weather patterns and rising global temperatures can contribute to more extreme and unpredictable weather events, potentially increasing the frequency and severity of floods.</li>
        </li>Poor Drainage Systems: Inadequate or poorly maintained drainage systems in urban and rural areas can exacerbate flooding by preventing water from efficiently flowing away.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Type of Floods</h2>
    <section class="Type">
        <ul>
            <li>Riverine Floods: These occur when rivers, streams, or other water bodies overflow their banks due to heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. Riverine floods are among the most common and widespread types of floods.</li>
    
            <li>Flash Floods: These are rapid and sudden floods characterized by a swift onset of rising water levels, often within a few hours or even minutes. They typically occur in low-lying areas or urban regions with poor drainage systems, and are commonly triggered by intense rainfall, dam breaks, or sudden release of water.</li>
    
            <li>Coastal Floods: Coastal areas can experience flooding due to storm surges caused by tropical storms, hurricanes, or tsunamis. High winds and low atmospheric pressure associated with these events can push large volumes of seawater inland, causing flooding in coastal communities</li>
            <li> Urban Floods: Also known as pluvial floods, these occur in urban or metropolitan areas due to inadequate drainage systems, impervious surfaces like roads and buildings that prevent water from being absorbed, and heavy rainfall. Urban floods often lead to water accumulation in streets and low-lying areas.</li>
    
            <li>Groundwater Floods: Excessive rainfall or rapid snowmelt can saturate the soil, leading to an increase in the groundwater table. If the capacity of the soil to absorb water is exceeded, the excess water can surface, causing flooding in nearby areas.</li>
    
            <li> Ice Jams and Snowmelt Floods: During periods of thaw, snowmelt can cause rivers and streams to overflow. Ice jams occur when chunks of ice accumulate and block the flow of water, causing it to spill over banks and flood surrounding areas.</li>
    
            <li> Dam Failure Floods: Failure or breach of dams or levees due to structural issues, excessive rainfall, or other factors can result in catastrophic flooding downstream. The sudden release of stored water can cause widespread devastation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Impact of Floods</h2>
    <section class="Impact">
        <ul>   
    
            <li>Property Damage and Loss: Floodwaters can damage or destroy homes, buildings, infrastructure (roads, bridges), crops, livestock, and personal belongings. This damage often leads to financial hardships for individuals and communities.</li>
    
            <li>Displacement and Homelessness: People affected by floods may be forced to evacuate their homes, leading to temporary or long-term displacement. This situation can result in homelessness, loss of livelihoods, and increased vulnerability, especially for marginalized communities.</li>
    
            <li>Economic Impact: Floods can disrupt businesses, agriculture, and industries, leading to loss of income, decreased productivity, and increased costs for recovery and reconstruction. The economic impact can be severe at local, regional, and national levels.</li>
    
            <li>Environmental Damage: Floods can have detrimental effects on ecosystems, leading to soil erosion, loss of vegetation, habitat destruction, and contamination of water bodies. They can also affect water quality and lead to the spread of pollutants.</li>
    
            <li>Infrastructure Disruption: Floods can damage critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, power lines, and water treatment facilities, disrupting essential services and hindering rescue and relief efforts.</li>
    
            <li>Social and Psychological Impact: Floods can have long-lasting psychological effects on individuals and communities, leading to trauma, anxiety, stress, and emotional distress, particularly for those who have experienced loss of life, property, or livelihoods.</li>
    
            <li>Impact on Agriculture and Food Security: Floods can destroy crops, contaminate soil, and damage agricultural infrastructure, affecting food production and leading to food shortages. This impact can have long-term consequences on food security.</li>
        </ul>
